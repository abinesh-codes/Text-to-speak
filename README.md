# Text-to-speak
I built this Text to Voice app for fun and to hone my skills. It converts text to speech with customizable controls for voice, pitch, rate, and volume. The project let me practice JavaScript and Web Speech API while designing an engaging, modern interface with glassmorphism and smooth animations. A creative, practical learning experience.
